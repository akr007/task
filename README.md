# task
Interview task.
Your task is to create a simple web application that implements a RESTful API approach.

Functional requirements:
- User log in: Pre-defined users of the system (stored in the database) can log in with their e-mail address and password
- Create / Edit / Delete advertisements: Logged in users should be able to create advertisements, edit or delete existing ones
- List advertisements: advertisements stored in the database needs to be listed
- Advertisements have titles and descriptions (no other fields needed) 

Technical requirements:
- Backend code: Java, php or C# can be chosen.
- Backend pattern: MVC
- Database: free of choice, MySQL preferred 
- Frontend: JavaScript, libraries are allowed
- User interactions have to be done using AJAX
- Frontend and backend have to communicate via REST web services

Solution requirements:
- Must be a unique work. Using an existing solution from the internet will result instant disqualification (we will google up your submitted code)
- The code must be documented (No need a separate project documentation)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Used technology: Java
Used IDE: Eclipse+Tomcat v10.0
Used Database: MySQL
Database: taskDB, tables: user, advertisement
Tomcat broke down midway, that is why the create and delete functions are not properly tested.
